ArtefactCharger
===============

App loads charge onto Artefact from any device connected to the internet. This simple application, desiged for use in synconjury, will automatically 'charge' any properly sigilized or formatted ritual objects in its immediate vicinity. The app uses static nostalgiic current generated by the internet to generate a subdimensional oscillation, effectively "energizing" said Artefact or ritual object.
